Lesson 2 Reflections
What happens when you initialize a repository?
Why do you need to do it?
It creates a new repository and you need to do
it because it's good.

How is the staging area different from the working 
directory and the repository? What value do you think
it offers?
The staging area is different because it's where 
you choose what files you want to commit to the 
repository. The working directory is simply the 
director in which you are working in.
